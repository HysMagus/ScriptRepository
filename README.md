# ScriptRepository
A Collection of Scripts for Different Purposes

I will not be actively maintaining every single script but just keeping these around for specific uses. Feel free to use them if you want if you want to republish or edit, just make sure to attribute me. If you want to sell this code, contact me. I don't understand why you would want to sell it but that's your problem
